AI agent toolkit for automated trading on Perpl (perpetual DEX on Monad).

## Build and Test

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Type check

## Overview

PerplBot is a TypeScript SDK and CLI for building trading bots on Perpl. It implements the **owner/operator wallet pattern** using the `delegated-account` smart contract, allowing secure separation between cold storage (owner) and hot trading wallets (operator).

**Key security feature**: Operators can NEVER withdraw funds - this is enforced at the smart contract level.

## Supported Operations

### Wallet Management
- Create cold (owner) wallet
- Create hot (operator) wallet
- Encrypted key storage with password

### Trading (Operator)
- Market open long/short (IOC)
- Limit open long/short
- Market close long/short
- Limit close long/short
- Reduce position (partial close)
- Add margin to position
- Cancel orders

### Account Management (Owner)
- Deploy DelegatedAccount
- Add/remove operators
- Deposit/withdraw collateral

### Portfolio Queries
- Get available markets
- Get positions
- Get account summary
- Get funding info
- Get trading fees

## Key Concepts

### Owner/Operator Pattern
- **Owner**: Cold wallet that owns the DelegatedAccount. Can withdraw funds, add/remove operators.
- **Operator**: Hot wallet for trading. Can only call allowlisted Exchange functions. CANNOT WITHDRAW.
- **DelegatedAccount**: Smart contract that enforces access control and forwards calls to Exchange.

### Contract Addresses (Monad Testnet)
- Exchange: `0x9C216D1Ab3e0407b3d6F1d5e9EfFe6d01C326ab7`
- Collateral (USD stable): `0xdF5B718d8FcC173335185a2a1513eE8151e3c027`

### Perpetual IDs (from dex-sdk testnet config)
- BTC: 16
- ETH: 32
- SOL: 48
- MON: 64
- ZEC: 256

Use `npx tsx scripts/check-markets.ts` to check market status.

## CLI Commands

### Deploy New Account
```bash
npm run dev -- deploy --implementation <addr> --operator <hot-wallet> --deposit 100
```

### Execute Trade
```bash
# Limit order
npm run dev -- trade open --perp btc --side long --size 0.1 --price 45000 --leverage 10

# Market order (IOC)
npm run dev -- trade open --perp btc --side long --size 0.1 --price 46000 --leverage 10 --ioc
```

### Check Status
```bash
npm run dev -- manage status
```

## SDK Usage

```typescript
import {
  KeyManager,
  OwnerWallet,
  OperatorWallet,
  Portfolio,
  getChainConfig,
  priceToPNS,
  lotToLNS,
  leverageToHdths,
} from "perplbot";

// Secure key management
const keyManager = new KeyManager("./.perplbot/keys");
const { address } = keyManager.createHotWallet("password");

// Setup operator
const config = getChainConfig();
const operator = OperatorWallet.fromPrivateKey(key, config);
operator.connect(exchangeAddr, delegatedAccountAddr);

// Market order
await operator.marketOpenLong({
  perpId: 0n,
  lotLNS: lotToLNS(0.1),
  leverageHdths: leverageToHdths(10),
  maxPricePNS: priceToPNS(46000),
});

// Portfolio queries
const portfolio = new Portfolio(exchange, publicClient, exchangeAddr);
portfolio.setAccountId(accountId);
const positions = await portfolio.getPositions();
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode
- Use viem for blockchain interactions
- Prefer async/await over callbacks
- Export types alongside implementations

## Workflow

- Create feature branches from `main`
- Write clear commit messages
- Run `npm run typecheck` before committing
- Run `npm test` to verify changes

## Workflow Orchestration
### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update tasks/lessons-md*
with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When I report a bug, don't start by trying to fix it. Instead, start by writing a test that reproduces the bug. Then, have subagents try to fix the bug and prove it with a passing test.
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
1. **Plan First**: Write plan to 'tasks/todo.md with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. *Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to 'tasks/todo.md*
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update 'tasks/lessons.md after corrections

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
- **Document Features**: When adding new features, update all relevant docs (README.md, CLAUDE.md, skill files, /perpl help).
